In this project I tried to put various Swift UI techniques to make better UI's which you can see in the below screenshots.

Let's Discuss the power of this project:
This project shows the current tech news around our globe with help of an Api fetching.
It covers localisations to cover more than one language.
It covers feedback option.
It covers side menu.
It covers login log out option.
It covers radiant background colour screens.
It covers tabs at the below screen

You can add notes what you get knowledge from app news and save them for future readings.


And all this magic is done by Swift-UI
